Introduction to Event Management System
Event Management System (EMS) is a software application designed to streamline and simplify the process of planning, organizing, and managing events. Whether you're organizing workshops, meetings, conferences, or any other type of event, an efficient EMS can be a powerful tool to help you achieve your goals. This project aims to provide a fundamental Event Management System that enables users to create, manage, and display events.

Development Process
The development of this Event Management System involved several key steps:
1. Requirement Gathering: We started by gathering the requirements for the system. This included understanding the needs of event organizers, the data they need to manage, and the features they require.
2. Design and Architecture: The system was designed with a focus on modularity and extensibility. The use of object-oriented programming allowed us to create a flexible structure that can accommodate different types of events.
3. Key Features:
   - Event Types: The system supports two types of events: Workshops and Meetings, with the flexibility to add more event types in the future.
   - Event Creation: Users can easily create new events by providing essential information such as title, date, topic (for workshops), and agenda (for meetings).
   - Event Display: The system can display the list of events, including details specific to each event type.
4. Implementation: The code was developed with C++ and takes advantage of object-oriented programming principles to create a hierarchy of classes, making it easy to manage different event types.

5. User Interface:The system provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the application. Users can choose to add events, view events, and exit the system.
6. Testing: Extensive testing was performed to ensure the system's reliability and correct functionality. This included testing various input scenarios, error handling, and ensuring that the events are displayed accurately.
7. Documentation: Proper documentation was prepared, including this introduction, to provide a clear understanding of the project's purpose and functionality.

Key Points
- Flexibility: The system is designed with flexibility in mind. New event types can be added easily by creating additional child classes of the Event class.
- Simplicity: The command-line interface is user-friendly, making it accessible to users with varying technical expertise.
- Error Handling: The system includes robust error handling to address invalid user input, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Object-Oriented Design: Object-oriented programming principles are utilized to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
- Extensibility: The architecture allows for future expansion and the addition of more features to meet evolving event management needs.

In summary, this Event Management System is a versatile and easy-to-use tool for individuals and organizations looking to efficiently manage and display their events. Its simple design, flexibility, and extensibility make it a valuable resource for various event management scenarios.
